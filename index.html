  WORLDS OF cake                              </h1>
  <h2>
  'How big this cake is!' 'What a' (Exclamation)

  <h3> Choosing from the constructions you suggest, my most likely response would be "What a big cake!"
My impression is that the "How + adjective" construction is no longer active in American English. It would certainly be understood, but a native speaker would produce it only in fixed phrases or with a sarcastic tone.                    </h3>
